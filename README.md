**`Digital Journaling (Developer / Calisthenics)`**

I am Varady aka KazperCoder. I have been working as a web developer since the mid 2023 and still counting. I always try to learn and keep improving my skill from day to day. As I am doing so, I think that it will be a good idea to keep or document my journey so that I can always come back to reflect from the starting point of my journey. I find it really interesting to understand how thing works and really appreciate the people who come up with it. I do not know everything. but I can always learning anything.

    <summary><h3> KazperCoder's Coding Journey. </h3></summary>
    I started of as a computer science student who had no idea of what is waiting for me in the future all I know was that it had something to do with computer and I like working with computer. The environment I grew up with did not give me enough exposure to what we knew as computer programming. I finished high school with the least amount of knowledge in computer programming. However, I didn't give up and still keep going until my 3rd year in university that I pick the field I like which to become software engineer. From there, I started to learn the language of the web which were HTML, CSS and Javascript. I started to apply for a web design internship at a company with this minimum knowledge I had. Luckily I got into a startup software company specialize in building solution for Human Resource managment and Cusomter Relationship management(CRM). Yet with different position. I keep learning until the mid of 2023 that I finally able to working an IT department of the same company. Things started to make more sense, since I was able to put my learning into practice by solving a real business problem what people were dealing with. My ability to understand the existing codebase has improved so much. I tried so hard that my performance and skill improved to the point that I am able to become a core member of the team handling in maintain and extend the existing feature to make it even more useful. I work in client-side which required me to use Laravel blade with Vuejs and jquery to handle the client's interaction that need an API integration. I also work in the backend side using Laravel and building an API the application. Even now I still think that I have a very long way to go and a lot of things to explore but this time I am going to doucment my journey. I also hope to be able to build a connection with the amazing people out there and learn from them.
